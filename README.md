# Self-Traversed-Reasoning-A-Zero-Cost-Anti-Model-
(STR), a zero-cost inference protocol that transforms standard transformers into self-auditing systems. Unlike chain-of-thought reasoning which discards intermediate computational states, STR recovers already-computed alternatives from probability distributions, creating a topological map of decision space through branched traversal
